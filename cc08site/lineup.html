          <p class="pagecontent">ABSTRACT: <span class="PagecontentAlternates">Format String Vulnerabilities 101</span><br>
            A comprehensive presentation on format string vulnerabilities within the Windows Intel Architecture environment. This presentation will take the audience from the basics of discovering format string vulnerabilities, through to the execution of exploit code. Using a debugger, we will show how format strings can trigger various exceptions and gain control of the flow of execution within a vulnerable application. Presentation will include several live demonstrations.<br>

          <p class="pagecontent">ABSTRACT: <span class="PagecontentAlternates">Local-Link Networking</span><br>
            As the SOHO networks grow with home-automation and networked entertainment systems, the home user will have more installation concerns than the typical blinking 12:00. While TCP/IP is a terrific wide-area protocol, it wasn't designed to fill the niche of the local-area protocols it eventually replaced, leaving us with a bare local network. This presentation will show how protocols such as SLP, UPnP, and Zeroconf address the issues of local-link networking, including a demonstration of Zeroconf with Linux using Avahi.<br>

            When conducting a digital forensic investigation that involves a breach or compromise of network systems, sound knowledge of digital forensic procedures may not be enough. Understanding the system being investigated and the ways that a system can be compromised can lead to a greater understanding of the events that comprised the attack. This 'Ethical Hacking in Forensics' hands-on lab will take students through some of the more common attacks that Crackers execute against network systems today.<br>

          <p>ABSTRACT: <span class="PagecontentAlternates">Blogging for Bad Guys: What Not to Say On-Line</span><br>
            The preponderance of social networking sites enables individuals to share all sorts of information about their lives. Interestingly, criminals and deviants are using this technology to discuss their lives and activities. As a consequence, researchers and law enforcement can better understand the motivations, actions, and routines of criminals, thus linking individuals behind computers to criminal events on and offline. This presentation will discuss the complexities and challenges involved in examining and compiling information about bad guys of all sorts from around the glove, with particular emphasis on malware writers, carders, and other nefarious types. In addition, this talk can provide examples of why you should not provide any details about your personal beliefs and behaviors in online outlets.<br>

          <p>ABSTRACT: <span class="PagecontentAlternates">Exploit-Me Series: Firefox Application Penetration Testing Suite</span><br>
          The cost of fixing bugs is drastically reduced in the development stage compared to production. If developers and QA engineers have the proper tools they will be able to scan their applications for security vulnerabilities. The Exploit-Me series of tools is the basis for this tool set. The XSS-Me plug-in provides the ability to scan for reflective Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. SQL Inject-Me provides the ability to look for SQL injection vulnerabilities. By building these plug-ins into the development cycle, developers and QA engineers will be able to find security issues early.</p>
          <p>This presentation will take a demonstration-based approach and will provide examples of advanced XSS and SQL Injection attacks and display how the Exploit-Me tools can be used to identify these vulnerabilities in the application, thus empowering the attendees with the ability to search for such vulnerabilities in their applications.<br>
