  The Carolinacon Group, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to technology education, will be hosting a technology conference titled "Carolinacon 2008" on March 28-29 in Chapel Hill, NC. This is our fourth annual conference. We will have speakers and presentations on a wide variety of science and technology topics. There will also be tech knowledge trivia games. The conference is a great way to meet other like-minded technology enthusiasts and to knowledge-share with your peers. There is a lot of opportunity for both learning and socializing. In many ways, Carolinacon is like a whole semester of college, all in one weekend.</p>
