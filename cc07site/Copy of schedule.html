                  Computer attackers no longer need to rely on their abilities, as malware and automated tools quickly and efficiently perform attacks for them. Individuals can buy access to sophisticated malware, including bots, Trojans, and worms via markets run in publicly accessible web forums centered primarily out of Eastern Europe and Russia. These forums also operate black markets where individuals can sell the data they illegally obtain for a profit. Since these markets are dynamic and often written in foreign languages, it is not fully understood how these markets operate. Using a sample of publicly accessible web forums that traffic in malware and personal information, this talk will explore the current state of the on-line black market. The data are used to understand the quantity and type of data being traded and sold, and identify the dynamics of sellers and buyers in these markets. This talk should benefit anyone with an interest in computer security or hacking by detailing the methods and tactics of malware writers and data theives, as well as upcoming malware threats.</li>

              <p align="left">This presentation would encompass a wide variety of simple electronic circuit elements and how to assemble them into working circuits. The elements that would be examined in the presentation would include power sources, resistors, diodes, Timer ICs, Op-Amps, and testing equipment. I will cover how to use the equipment and also include an introduction to soldering the circuit elements onto mounting boards. I would go over how to assemble or purchase all of the components to build the circuits and test them. To conclude I would demonstrate a few simple circuits and how to build them at home along with where to purchase or obtain the components. </p>

              <p align="left">This panel discussion will cover the major hurdles to be made in creating and maintaining a hacker lab for your local group or club. The esteemed panel of current CCG lab scientists will discuss lessons learned in the pursuit of obtaining and maintaining a hacker lab for the NC2600 community.<br>
                <br>
                The CCG lab is currently in operation, and is a non-profit research laboratory dedicated to creating innovations in the fields of computer security and software development. Its inspirations lie in places like the infamous l0pht and less-known but still l33t NOLAB. By striving for technical skills development and by using knowledge-sharing, the goal of the CCG lab is for computer security-minded persons to explore and learn in a heterogeneous networked environment.<br>
                <br>
              Major panel topics to be covered include; funding, finding an appropriate location, physical/network access control, network design, projects, membership/participation, and obtaining hardware/software. Questions from the audience are also encouraged, as the panel and sponsoring non-profit hopes to inspire other groups to build their own labs.</p>

              <p align="left">This presentation will cover the knowledge needed to setup, run, and win a capture the flag game. The setup portion of the presentation will cover how the scoring application works and the details of setting up the hardware. Advanced topics such as using a Honeywall to log attacks that happen during the game will be touched on as well. After an explanation of the inner workings of how the game works an open discussion of tips and tricks on how to bend the rules without breaking them will follow. A prize will be awarded to the person who has the best tip as voted on by the attendees, so bring your best hack.</p>

              </div>
              <p align="left">Secrecy is the practice of hiding information from others, yet often involves sharing that same information with a select individual or group. That which is kept hidden is known as the secret. Secrecy is often controversial. Excessive secrecy is often cited as a source of much human conflict. Some 2,500 years ago Sophocles wrote, &quot;Do nothing secretly; for time sees and hears all things, and discloses all.&quot; Vic adds a single word of wisdom to that mantra, which is simply &quot;ditto&quot;.</p>
                <p align="left">Even though Vic secretly has many personal secrets he can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t share secretly, everyone knows the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets. Therefore he shall share the secrets of keeping and sharing secrecy, without the use of traditional cryptography. Freeware tools and live demos will not-secretly be included in the presentation, and any audience members (who care to) can try to crack the hidden contents/codes. Various &quot;practical&quot; uses for such techniques will be provided, although Vic officially doesn&rsquo;t endorse or condone the examples to be provided.</p>

It will also serve as a very basic introduction to human natural intelligence, touching on the subtlety and robustness of human natural intelligence. Also included will be; demonstrations on concepts such as change blindness and memory limitation, consciousness&rsquo;s role in intelligence, various parts of the brain and their theoretical role in natural human intelligence, and current and future technological application of current cortical understanding. Questions from the audience will also be taken.</p>

              </div>
              <p align="left">This talk will include a demonstration on what is knowingly and unknowingly<br>
                stored on a typical hard drive. If your hard drive was seized today, could law<br>
                enforcement prosecute you? We will explore how criminals try to hide their<br>
                precious data and how it can be recovered by a skilled computer forensics<br>
                expert. Filesystem internals, encryption, data hiding and data recovery will be<br>
              covered.</p>

              <p align="left">The goal of this talk is to introduce participants to the theory of visualization and its use in realworld to visually analyze, explore, discover, and compare within data. This talk discusses a number of important issues in visualization with the help of a series of descriptions, examples, and practical applications. The talk is directed towards students and researchers who would like an overview of visualization, and its applicability to different domains. No prior knowledge in visualization is necessary.</p>
