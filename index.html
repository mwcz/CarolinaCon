                <p><strong>DISCOUNT HOTEL RESERVATIONS</strong>: If you would like to take
                advantage of our special group rate on hotel rooms (good till
                February 12th 2013), go to this Hilton.com link for direct
                booking:</p>

                <p><strong>ATTENTION!</strong>  The special room rate will be
                available until February 12th or until the group block is
                sold-out, whichever comes first.  Also if we don't meet our
                quota of rooms with the Hilton the hotel will jack up our rate
                on the conference rooms we reserved for the weekend, which may
                impact our ability to break even on the event.  So if you plan
                on staying in a hotel that weekend we hope it will be the
                Hilton and we hope that you will book under the discount group
                rate prior to February 12th 2013.</p>

                abstracts to fit them all into the schedule, and we regret that
                we didn't have room for them all.  Thanks to everyone who

                <p>
                We don't accept any, so please don't bother asking.  Capitalism and
                philanthropic knowledge-sharing don't mix in our opinion.  We keep our
                admission price to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses.
                All of our staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy.
                All of our presenters generously donate their time and talent.  The only items
                sold at CarolinaCon are a limited quantity of single-design CarolinaCon
                t-shirts....and we only make and sell those because attendees and staff want
                them (and because they're cool).

                 <p>Admission to the conference is $20 at the door. There is no pre-registration. For your $20 you will receive admission to the conference and a cool CarolinaCon badge. In past years we've also given away magazines, bumper stickers, shot glasses, and free food with the cost of admission. There's no telling what we'll be giving away this year so you'll have to attend to find out.</p>

                <p>We will also be selling t-shirts at the conference but a price for those shirts has not been determined yet. You can expect to pay similar prices to what other conferences charge for their shirts ($10~$20).</p>

                    So you've reversed you're first Android APK; now what? Java pseduocode is nice, but how do we modify the app? This is a crash course in reading and understanding Davlik opcodes. It will go through some basics then we will jump into a couple case studies to demonstrate some of the concepts. This talk should help testers who are interested in or do Android application assessments to better understand how to mess with the underlying code.

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    There is a great deal of conversation today regarding APT and critical infrastructure networks for ICS/SCADA, smart grid networks and service providers. The basic persistent threat (BPT) issues are being ignored in many cases. How can the APT be mitigated when the BPT issues have not been resolved? Typically, the technical capability to mitigate BPT many of the APT risks already exist in the installed HW/SW but proper attention to trust relationships, integration and interdependencies are overlooked. Close attention should be given to the often overlooked network vulnerabilities in the network architecture and protocols that enable BPT. In this presentation common network BPT issues that are often discovered during security consulting engagements will be discussed. BPT network architecture mitigations including separation of services for control, management and data traffic as well as securing and monitoring trust relationships and interdependencies will be covered.

                    <h3>Title:</h3> Jargon Jitsu: The Tao of Buzzwords<br>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    Moore’s law states that IT systems will double in processing power every 18 months. However, security has not progressed at the same rate…seriously, it is 2012 and enterprise organisations are still arguing over whether or not 7 or 8 character passwords are stronger. ORLY? As a security industry what have we done about it? We’ve introduced standards like PCI DSS that further exacerbate the problem. Why? Because they prescribe the security controls required in order to meet some arbitrary compliance requirement. This is totally arse-about from how any well run enterprise project would be executed; define the objectives and then develop the controls/outcomes from there. Security is not unlike a tesseract; we cannot see what ‘secure’ looks like, but we can describe what the end results of security will look like. This presentation is a look at how buzzwords and poorly-constructed standards have actually hindered security in enterprise and what we as a security community can do about it.

                    You have locks on your network closet. Great. What if I can open them in 30 seconds or less? This talk will explore the basic-level concepts of various types of locks and how/why they can be picked. This information should be common knowledge by now, but given the need for free and open information sharing, it really can never be reviewed too often. Plus you're sure to get some seriously inappropriate humor alongside all of it.

                    In this talk, I explore a seldom-discussed facet of airport security: what happens after the backscatter/millimeter wave scan or the friendly pat-down? A marginally resourceful and MacGyver-esque individual can breeze through terminal gift shops, restaurants, magazine stands and duty-free shops to find everything they need to wage war on an airplane. We'll take weapons — melee, projectile, and beyond — from concept to prototype in this serious (yet often humorous) talk, replete with photos and video.

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    Penetration Tests aren't new, and most companies have figured out how
                    to eliminate
                    the low hanging fruit. Some have even gone above and beyond and
                    deployed technologies like Network AV, IPS, and egress filtering. In 50
                    minutes, this talk is going to
                    go through different ways of getting access to systems on the network
                    without exploits and working around common hardening. Leveraging
                    configuration weaknesses, common hardening oversights, and more, we'll
                    go through ways to get around difficult AV systems,
                    network AV, using open source and commonly available tools to get access
                    to boxes were the standard stuff fails. Join us for a adventure with

                    <h3>Title:</h3> Burp Suite: A Comprehensive Web Pen Testing<br>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    I plan on showing some of the features of the Burp Suite and how it can be used to run Pen Tests on devices that have web authentication. I will walk through setup and use of the target window to store proxy requests, and then combine that with the repeater, intruder and sequencer to attack the site. My talk will explain how we can use each view to analyze and view responses as we modify packets on the fly. I plan to show how Burp helps you bypass site XSS and SQL injection checking, directory traversal, client side login checks, and find non-random sessions keys.
                    <br>
                    The last part of the demo I will show how I successfully used this in order to bypass the web authentication on an Iomega drive Network
                    Access System. Without knowing the details of the CVE, upload a backdoor to the NAS and gain root so that I can use it as a pivot point and mount other attacks into the victims network... all with using Burp. All of this will be presented live, however instructions and PowerPoint will be provided so anyone can repeat this demo on their own.

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    Brief Topic Abstract: This presentation is for anyone interested in learning the true power of search. While the vast majority of people think of search engines as gateways to movie times, shopping deals, and a little fact-checking, the reality is that advanced search queries are being used via the most popular search engines every day to find unbelievable types of information. Search has proven time and again that even the most paranoid and cautious individuals can find themselves on the business end of identity theft, and they'd never know how it happened. If you don't know how to use a search engine to find credit card scans, Social Security numbers, usernames and passwords, VPN credentials, back-up images, virtual machine installs, software licenses, confidential documents, private image/video dumps, or similarly fascinating/frightening data, then I'm offering you the chance to take the red pill and see just how deep the search engine rabbit hole really goes...

                    <h3>Title:</h3> iPhone data reconnaissance without physical access to the device.<br>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    I'll explore methodologies for iOS data reconnaissance without physical access to the device. Using a non jailbroken iPhone, I'll show how to use a local network to use common settings on devices to remotely backup the device to its paired instance of iTunes (assuming network or physical access to the computer), find the backup on disk, and extract things like the TXT/iMessage raw sqlite database to the recent calls list. 
                    <br>
                    These tactics can be used to automate backups of your own device for safekeeping of data or for more nefarious things like recovering text message logs from a spouse's phone to see what they've ben up to behind your back. I'll show example SQL queries to adjust date/timestamps and account for an Apple bug that made it into production with iMessage database records which will make it easier to work with the data. I'll also show a simple way to protect against this sort of data reconnaissance by others.

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    This presentation will cover how network and internet security is evolving. No matter how big your organization is, the possibility of having your network hacked is now higher than ever. This presentation will discuss how the attack landscape is changing and how large scale cyber-espionage campaigns have been pwning networks for years.  People always think of nation-state hacks against large defense contractors, big government offices, and profile financial institutions, but anyone can be a victim.  This presentation will also cover how organizations mature in their security strategy to try to maintain a good security posture, but in a lot of cases are unsuccessful.

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    Most, if not all, executables generated by msfpayload/msfencode/msfvenom get destroyed by every antivirus available. Msfpayload is still fantastic, but it's inevitable that something this fantastic will get a lot of attention from AV providers. It is crucial for security professionals to have reliable payloads to provide quality deliverables to their clients. Rather than having a theoretical discussion regarding various avoidance techniques, this talk will demonstrate methods that these chaps use on a regular basis with ridiculous success rates. Of particular focus will be ghost-writing ASM, use of binary-level encryption for payloads, and remote command execution for shell generation.
