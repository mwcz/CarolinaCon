                <h2>Hotel Reservations</h2>
                <p><strong>DISCOUNT HOTEL RESERVATIONS</strong>: If you would like to take
                advantage of our special group rate on hotel rooms, go to this
                Hilton.com link for direct booking:</p>
                 
                <p><a href="http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/R/RDUNHHF-CAR-20130315/index.jhtml">Reserve a room!</a></p>
                 
                <p><strong>ATTENTION!</strong>  The special room rate will be
                available until February 12th or until the group block is
                sold-out, whichever comes first.  Also if we don't meet our
                quota of rooms with the Hilton the hotel will jack up our rate
                on the conference rooms we reserved for the weekend, which may
                impact our ability to break even on the event.  So if you plan
                on staying in a hotel that weekend we hope it will be the
                Hilton and we hope that you will book under the discount group
                rate prior to February 12th 2013.</p>

                <h2>CALL FOR PAPERS</h2>
                <p>The Call for Papers has ended.  We received too many great
                abstracts to fit them all into the schedule, and we regret that
                we didn't have room for them all.  Thanks to everyone who
                submitted something.</p>

                <h3>SPONSORS and/or VENDORS:</h3>
                <p>
                We don't accept any, so please don't bother asking.  Capitalism and
                philanthropic knowledge-sharing don't mix in our opinion.  We keep our
                admission price to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses.
                All of our staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy.
                All of our presenters generously donate their time and talent.  The only items
                sold at CarolinaCon are a limited quantity of single-design CarolinaCon
                t-shirts....and we only make and sell those because attendees and staff want
                them (and because they're cool).
                </p>

              <h2>Want to attend CarolinaCon? </h2> 
                 <p>Admission to the conference is $20 at the door. There is no pre-registration. For your $20 you will receive admission to the conference and a cool CarolinaCon badge. In past years we've also given away magazines, bumper stickers, shot glasses, and free food with the cost of admission. There's no telling what we'll be giving away this year so you'll have to attend to find out.</p>

                <p>We will also be selling t-shirts at the conference but a price for those shirts has not been determined yet. You can expect to pay similar prices to what other conferences charge for their shirts ($10~$20).</p>

                <h3>What events will be at CarolinaCon?</h3>

                <p>CarolinaCon is mainly about the educational talks, presentations, and demos. Alongside those we will have several other technology-related contests and challenges. Details on other events will be announced on our website as they are planned out.</p>

                <h3>Can my company sponsor CarolinaCon?</h3>

                <p>Well that's a different story.  We will gladly accept donations from anyone who wants to contribute.  At CarolinaCon, we pride ourselves on not charging a lot for admission so we don't have a lot to spend on giveaways (we manage though).  We can always use prizes for Hacker Trivia and various other contests that we run so if you want to donate an actual prize, rather than cash, just let us know by sending an email to info@carolinacon.org.  We'll also take cash. :-)</p>
