   <font size="-1"><b><font color="#ffff00">Identifying Cyberwarriors: Predicting 
Civilian Participation  in On-line Conflict</font><br>
   </b><br>
   There  has been a substantial increase in reports of civilian attacks
against   all manner of government and private industry targets on and off-line. 
 The globalization of the Internet and increasing civil unrest across the
  world indicates that individuals are beginning to recognize the value 
of  cyberattacks as a response to governmental practices and regulations.
 In  fact, the availability of malware and mass movements like Anonymous
 enable  unskilled actors to engage in attacks against various targets, 
including  critical infrastructure, to force social change.  As a  consequence,
the rise of the "civilian cyberwarrior" as adopted by Dorothy  Denning and
Max Kilger may cause shifts in the power relationship  between individuals
and nation states. This presentation will utilize  samples of college students
from the US and Taiwan to examine the  predictors of individual willingness
to engage in attacks against their  own nation and other countries on and
off-line. The findings will  examine prospective behavioral and attitudinal
factors that affect the  likelihood that individuals will engage in attacks,
and consider  regional differences that may affect action.  This talk will
benefit the  intelligence community and security researchers by predicting
and  modeling the dynamics of threats to national security and private data
 and respond when they occur.<br>

   <br>
   When  giving a security talk on the Android platform, one of the most
common   questions is can the permissions model be bypassed? Can an Android
app,  short of exploiting the phone and gaining root privileges gain  additional 
 permissions? In this talk we will look at multiple ways to  bypass the permission 
 model including: bypassing through application  updates, bypassing through 
 using multiple apps, taking advantage of  insecure storage practices in other
 installed apps, and piggybacking on  other apps with insecurely implemented 
 interfaces. Demos, code snippets  and examples of apps from the Android Market
 with these problems will be  shown. We will then discuss resources Android
 has in place to combat  these problems and what developers and users can
do to mitigate these  risks.<br>

Hacked - Several Times!!!</b></font><br>
   <br>
   Abstract: Many times security professionals, network engineers, and management 
 ask "why did I spend all this money in network security equipment if I still 
 got hacked?" For example, often questions like<br>
   these run through their minds: "Am I not buying the right security products?&nbsp; 
 Am I not configuring or deploying them correctly? Do I have the right staff 
 to run my network?" The security lifecycle requires measuring the current 
 network state, creating a baseline and providing constant improvements. This
 presentation will cover several real-life case studies on how different network
 segments were compromised despite that state-of-the-art network security
technologies and products were deployed. We will go over several security
metrics that you should understand in order to better protect your network.<br>

   <br>
   When it comes to penetration testing, developers are sometimes smarter 
 than your average user and can be overlooked. Generally they hold  elevated
 privileges and have access to more resources, making them an  attractive
target. In this presentation, we'll explore methods to  exploit developers
and products under development by targeting  dependency management repositories.<br>
   <br>
   I've been  working on a project that is intended to be able to exploit 
developers   or products under development by hijacking a repository, and 
serving up a  modified (currently static, working on real-time) version of 
the  dependency  that was requested. End result is a product/box that is 
already compromised  before release.<br>

platforms (Zeus,  SpyEye,Bugat)  to general tools (Sunspot) to target specific 
industries</b></font><br>
   <br>
   There  has been a recent surge in the release of malware source code,
which   involves crimepack authors from different locations working together
to  refine their products.  Crimeware authors are leveraging the release
of  source to further develop their already sophisticated and well developed
   threats as well as add modularity and functionality to their software.
 In addition the release of Zeus and TDL3 source adds to the wealth of  information 
 already available further lowering the entry barrier for  developers and 
price point for would be criminals looking to enter the  malware market space. 
Zeus, SpyEye, (and others like them) are tools  that are built specifically 
to target the financial industry, whereas  Sunspot is a general purpose tool 
 that modifies specifically to target  banks. This is significant because 
tools and techniques that are built  to detect the former do not work with 
the latter. <br>
   Tracking these  trends can be accomplished by leveraging classification
 and clustering  models that are built on Behavioral analysis tools. This
paper  demonstrated a technique that allows the analyst and end user to easily 
  compares changes and feature enhancements through the development cycle 
 of a particular malware family.<br>

   <br>
   The convergence of social networking, location based services, and  biometric 
 security, seek to enhance the digital usability of our  environment. Biometric 
 authentication creates a new layer of critical  and irrevocable personally 
 identifiable information (PII). Developments  in image acquisition techniques 
 and advances in sensors make it possible  to remotely capture and collect 
 human traits-- a means of biometric  surveillance. The constant acquisition, 
 aggregation, and multi-modal  fusion of personal data create numerous vulnerabilities 
 to personal  privacy. When combined with dataveillance, threats against 
re-identification, inferential linkage analysis, and deductive  disclosure
 have become more consequential. A rising number of  organizations are faced
 with adopting Privacy Enhancing Technologies  (PET) for securely managing
 biometric information. However, in the  absence of biometric compliance
standards,  the end use of this personal  information is a growing privacy
concern.  This presentation will  address current biometric systems, new
methods of non-cooperative  biometric data acquisition, and the subsequent
vulnerabilities posed to  our personal privacy. In addition, it will discuss
some of the steps  individuals can take to protect their anonymity in a digitally
panoptic  world.<br>

   <br>
   CAPTCHAs  are a potent mechanism to prevent web applications against the 
 ravaging  bots and appear to be omnipresent across the World Wide Web. To 
 analyze  the strength of CAPTHA deployments on the internet, a research spanning
  hundreds of high traffic websites and several CAPTCHA service providers
 was conducted. The research looked at CAPTCHA image design, CAPTCHA  implementation
 and Verification mechanisms. During the research, several  interesting implementation
 flaws and attacks were identified that will  be discussed during the presentation.
 Some of these flaws/attacks  include CAPTCHA fixation, CAPTCHA Rainbow Tables,
 In-Session CAPTCHA  Bruteforcing, OCR Assisted CAPTCHA Bruteforcing, Chosen
 CAPTCHA Text  Attack, CAPTCHA Accumulation etc&#8230; It was also observed that
 an alarming  number of visual CAPTCHAs (image designs) could be broken by
 combination  of good image preprocessing and Optical Character Recognition
 (OCR)  engines. TesserCap was thus written to test CAPTHA designs based
upon   these observations. TesserCap is a GUI based, highly flexible and
first  of its kind CAPTCHA analysis tool.  TesserCap retrieves CAPTCHAs from
 the  target website and solves those locally. Each CAPTCHA is subjected
 to TesserCap's  stage image preprocessing module and the OCR engine. The
 image preprocessing  algorithms work around color complexities, spatial
 irregularities, and other  types of random noise that developers  introduce
into the CAPTCHAs to achieve  higher detection rates.<br>

  packages built using Xerox Downloadable modules (DLM) format. Examining 
 Xerox patch process, including how they are obtained and deployed. We  will 
 Also discuss the structure and extraction of data from DLMs.  Leveraging 
this information we will demonstrate how an attacker could  easily create 
their own rogue DLMs and deploy them to take aver a Xerox  MFP device with 
root level privileges without needing to authenticate.  In conclusion we will
discuss methods that could be used to reduce or mitigate the risk caused by

networks</b></font><br>
   <br>
   A &#8220;burner computer&#8221; will cause all  of the same problems that a burner 
phone  previously caused for law  enforcement.  The burner phone allowed illegal
 activities to be  conducted with minimal risk to the user.  The potential
 &#8220;burner  computer&#8221; can be set up with nearly any lightweight distro of Linux
 and  can be programmed to do nearly any task.  For example, a member of
a   &#8220;cyber terrorist&#8221; organization can purchase Raspberry Pi and set it up
 with a script that will allow it to be part of a DDoS attack on any  given
target.  Normally, this &#8220;terrorist&#8221; would have to reroute their  network
 traffic through a VPN or the Tor Network.  It is possible,  although the
possibility is slim, that the attacker could be traced back  and arrested.
 RasPi enables this person to walk into a public library  or a coffee shop
and begin their attack.  They are then able to walk  away leaving the computer
behind with no discernable trace as to whom it  belongs.  The computer can
then execute the script at whatever point in  time the script is set to begin.
 Worst-case scenario would be that if  traced, only $35 is lost with no personal
risk.  If the RasPi remains  undiscovered, the attacker can make a new SD
card with a new target to  be attacked, and then casually swap out the card
onto the RasPi and walk  away again.  There can be hundreds of these setup
anywhere there is an  Ethernet port available, essentially creating hundreds
of untraceable  attackers.  &nbsp;This will create a new option in the playbook
for &#8220;hacktivists&#8221; and  &#8220;cyber terrorists&#8221; which will create a need for a
response by law  enforcement, network security professionals, and digital
forensic  professionals. <br>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Who develops and delivers CarolinaCon?</h3>

<p>CarolinaCon is proudly brought to you by "The CarolinaCon Group". The CarolinaCon Group is a non-profit organization registered in the state of NC, dedicated to educating the local and global communities about technology, information/network/computer security, and information rights. The CarolinaCon Group is also closely associated with various "2600" chapters across NC, SC, TN, VA, LA, DC, and NY. Many of the volunteers who help develop and deliver CarolinaCon come from those chapters.</p>

<h3>What events will be at CarolinaCon?</h3>

<p>CarolinaCon is mainly about the educational talks, presentations, and demos. Alongside those we will have several other technology-related contests and challenges. Details on other events will be announced on our website as they are planned out.</p>

<h3>Can my company sponsor CarolinaCon?</h3>

<p>We don't accept any, so don't bother asking. Capitalism and philanthropic knowledge-sharing don't mix in our opinion. We keep our admission price to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses. All of our staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy. All of our presenters generously donate their time and talent. The only items sold at CarolinaCon are a limited quantity of single-design CarolinaCon t-shirts....and we only make and sell those because attendees and staff want them.</p>

<h3>What about donating to CarolinaCon?</h3>

<p>Well that's a different story.  We will gladly accept donations from anyone who wants to contribute.  At CarolinaCon, we pride ourselves on not charging a lot for admission so we don't have a lot to spend on giveaways (we manage though).  We can always use prizes for Hacker Trivia and various other contests that we run so if you want to donate an actual prize, rather than cash, just let us know by sending an email to info@carolinacon.org.  We'll also take cash. :-)</p>
