                <h3>SPONSORS and/or VENDORS:</h3>
                <p>
                We don't accept any, so please don't bother asking.  Capitalism and
                philanthropic knowledge-sharing don't mix in our opinion.  We keep our
                admission price to the bare minimum to cover our venue and equipment expenses.
                All of our staff are volunteers who generously donate their time and energy.
                All of our presenters generously donate their time and talent.  The only items
                sold at CarolinaCon are a limited quantity of single-design CarolinaCon
                t-shirts....and we only make and sell those because attendees and staff want
                them (and because they're cool).
                </p>

              <h2>Want to attend CarolinaCon? </h2> 
                 <p>Admission to the conference is $20 at the door. There is no pre-registration. For your $20 you will receive admission to the conference and a cool CarolinaCon badge. In past years we've also given away magazines, bumper stickers, shot glasses, and free food with the cost of admission. There's no telling what we'll be giving away this year so you'll have to attend to find out.</p>

                <p>We will also be selling t-shirts at the conference but a price for those shirts has not been determined yet. You can expect to pay similar prices to what other conferences charge for their shirts ($10~$20).</p>

                <h3>Can my company sponsor CarolinaCon?</h3>

                <p>Well that's a different story.  We will gladly accept donations from anyone who wants to contribute.  At CarolinaCon, we pride ourselves on not charging a lot for admission so we don't have a lot to spend on giveaways (we manage though).  We can always use prizes for Hacker Trivia and various other contests that we run so if you want to donate an actual prize, rather than cash, just let us know by sending an email to info@carolinacon.org.  We'll also take cash. :-)</p>
