      Topic/Title: <br>
      Gender Issues in Hacking and Hacker Culture </span><br>
      <br>
      Abstract: <br>
      A great deal of academic research suggests hacker culture is largely male dominated. The gender differences present have not been systematically explored, though several theoretical explanations have been offered by sociologists and criminologists. As such, it is necessary to examine the gendered experiences of hackers to expand our knowledge of how these experiences impact individuals and their behavior. This talk will explore this issue using real world data from web forums and interviews with active hackers. I will also discuss my ongoing study examining male and female hackers' experiences, and call for interested individuals to participate in this research study. Audience participation is welcomed during the presentation to share personal feelings, beliefs, and knowledge about gender and hacking. <br>

          <br>
          Abstract: <br>
        This presentation will cover the ins and outs of FIRST robotics. A large part of the presentation will be devoted to the technical details of how to build a Competitive robot. The on board IO unit, the engineering behind it, and a lot of the build information will be covered. </p>

          Abstract: <br>
        NTFS and UFS2 filesystem internals will be explored in this session in detail. Discussion as will focus around information hiding, extraction, and data recovery techniques. Intrusion autopsy and law enforcement forensic tools and approaches will be exposed, as will means to potentially sidestep such analysis. </span></p>

          College of Hacking: Successful Network Penetration for Dummies </span><br>
          <br>
          Abstract: <br>
          Yes folks for the first (and last) time ever, you can attend Vic Vandal's "College of Hacking" at CarolinaCon for no additional cost (except your precious time...well precious for some anyway). Prepare for your new career in this fast-growing hi-tech field in under 2 hours, and walk away with an actual diploma afterward. Just imagine the look on your friends' faces when they learn that you are a degree-holding hacker! As a College of Hacking graduate, you'll be smug in the knowledge that no corporate computer system is safe from your talents. In fact Vic guarantees it, or he'll personally give you your course fees back. All you require is attendance and at least the intelligence level of your average primate. And if you have the intelligence level of your average human, so much the better. Just think, you'll be able to sleep <br>
          late and never have to worry about your bank balance again! <br>
        Vic will use actual live demonstrations as he walks you through the finer points of network enumeration, vulnerability discovery and exploitation, password plundering, system access level boosting, data destruction, electronic banking, and covering one's tracks. </p>

          Drive-by Hacking </span></span><span class="style1"><br>
          <br>
          Abstract: <br>
          Presentation will discuss speed-related traffic laws, and how we can use technology to make the roads safer and let drivers avoid speeding tickets. Will also talk about a project I have started and the software/hardware aspect of the following: <br>
        The TrapPoint Project aims to use war-driving tactics to gather and compile statistical data on different types of speed traps. The project will use a modified RADAR/LASER detector coupled with a GPS unit. The output will first get processed by a micro controller and will then be fed to a serial port. All data collected will be publicly available on the TrapPoint website. </span></p>

          From Here to E-ternity: A Chronology of the Phrack Microcosm</span> <br>
          <br>
          Abstract: <br>
          This talk will transport you back to the beginnings of ARPANET, through to 1982 and 110 Baud modems. Phreaking, Hacking, BBS's and the beginnings of "Elite" in the early-mid 80's. You'll be guided past the Great Hacker Wars, Eternal September, Operation Sundevil and into the decline of Phreaking, the rise of "script kiddy hacking" and the decline of the "Elite Underground" into the the modern day buzzword-laden society of <br>
"Hacker", "1337 speak" and everything "E". You'll hear first-hand from someone who has lived, experienced, and survived it with a few battle wounds of his own. </span></p>

          Topic/Title: <br>
          Reverse Engineering </span><br>
          <br>
          Abstract: <br>
          Reverse Engineering is the art of static and/or runtime analysis of a compiled binary to understand exact execution flow. The most straightforward way to demonstrate Reverse Engineering is by using sample code and diving into the tools. This talk will go over the basics of a computer system and supporting operating system in presentation format and then demonstrate simple reverse engineering techniques to analyze binaries and to "crack" the copyprotection that they use. At the completion of this presentation you will have a basic understanding of binary structure, computer system hardware and operating system design, <br>
      and the basic skill set to analyze the flow of a trivial binary.</p></td>
